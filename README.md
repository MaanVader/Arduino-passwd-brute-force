# Arduino-passwd-brute-force
For Petronas CTF finals 2023 this was the brute force script that I created to brute force Arduino's serial input

# Challenge discription:
This challenge requires a user to OSINT the user `alitawiz93` both on on instagram and on twitter and create a password list. Upon creating the list we then need to find a way to communiate with arduino serial input and brute force the passwd. To do this a script was developed using python's serial library to communicate with theserial inut.
